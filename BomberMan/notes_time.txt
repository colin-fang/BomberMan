My program reads an Input.txt file from within the same directory.
It will output the final board as well as the win/loss/stalemate condition
It can print out the board of every step it takes if PrintBoard is called every loop

My program reads the first 200 inputs and organizes it into a 2D array of Actors
Each Actor has 3 characters
There are a total of 13 actors created (1 empty, 1 rock, 1 player and 10 enemies)
The 2D array is populated by pointers that point to one of the 13 actors
The program then reads all inputs and interprets them as actions for the player and enemies
When actors move or die the pointers pointing to them simply point to a different actor (the empty actor) and a new pointer may be allocated to them

Thanks for this opportunity, it was a lot of fun! I look forward to hearing back from you again.

Time:

			2-3 hours spent on reading from the input text file
3-17-2022: approximately 5 hours spent on interpreting the text file and organizing it into a 2D array
3-18-2022: approximately 5 hours spent on creating all functions that handle actor actions
			approximately 2 hours spent on commenting, cleaning the code, checking all requirements are met
			approximately 30 minutes spent on final testing, and creating annotation and notes text file.
